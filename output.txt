I have completed and committed the implemented tasks for Phase 4 (Module 3 Isaac Sim setup guide, VSLAM, and Nav2 configurations).

The following tasks are still marked as **in-progress** and require your input:

*   **T020: Record and edit a video tutorial: "Building a Robot in URDF" (10 min).**
*   **T022: Create 10 practice exercises with solutions for the ROS 2 module.**
*   **T030: Record and edit a video tutorial: "Tuning Physics Parameters in Gazebo" (8 min).**
*   **T039: Generate dataset: 5000 annotated images.**

Please let me know if these tasks are now complete. If not, would you like me to proceed with the tasks in **Phase 5: Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**, or would you prefer to complete the pending tasks first?
