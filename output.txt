I have completed and committed task T019, which involved creating the URDF viewer component.

The next task is **T020: Record and edit a video tutorial: "Building a Robot in URDF" (10 min).** This task requires your intervention to create the video content.

I have marked T020 as "in-progress" in the `tasks.md` file and provided detailed instructions. Once you have created and placed the video in the specified directory, please let me know, and I will mark T020 as complete and proceed with embedding it in the relevant lesson.
