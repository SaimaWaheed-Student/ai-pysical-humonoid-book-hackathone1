I have completed and committed tasks T001, T002, and T003, which involved setting up the Docusaurus project and configuring its initial plugins and theme.

The next task is **T004: Set up the GitHub repository with a basic CI/CD workflow for deploying the Docusaurus site.** This task requires your intervention to create a GitHub repository and configure GitHub Actions.

I have marked T004 as "in-progress" in the `tasks.md` file. Once you have set up the GitHub repository and the CI/CD workflow as instructed previously, please let me know, and I will mark T004 as complete and proceed with the remaining tasks.
