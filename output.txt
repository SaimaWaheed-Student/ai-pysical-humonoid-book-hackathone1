The "Book", "Community", and "More" sections are already in the footer.

The footer is also already a dark blue color (`#1a202c`).

Could you please clarify what changes you would like to make to the existing footer? For example:
*   Would you like to add or remove links from the "Book", "Community", or "More" sections?
*   Would you like to change the shade of blue for the footer? If so, could you please provide a more specific color (e.g., "light blue", "royal blue", or a hex code like `#4A90E2`)?

I am awaiting your clarification.
