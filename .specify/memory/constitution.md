# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics: A Hands-On Guide Constitution

## Vision
To be the definitive hands-on guide for building and programming humanoid robots with cutting-edge AI, empowering beginners and intermediate engineers to create autonomous systems that can see, hear, and act in the real world.

## Core Principles

### I. Hands-On Learning First
Every concept must be tied to a practical, runnable code example. The book's primary value is in doing, not just reading. Theory should be presented in service of the practical application.

### II. Practical, Working Code (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code provided must be tested, version-controlled, and work as described. The end-of-module and capstone projects are the ultimate measure of success. Reproducibility is paramount; a user with the correct setup (Docker) should be able to run any example without friction.

### III. Modular and Progressive Structure
The book is structured in a clear, progressive path, from foundational concepts to advanced AI integration. Each module builds on the last, but is also self-contained enough to be a useful reference for a specific topic.

### IV. Cutting-Edge and Industry-Relevant
The tech stack (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac) is chosen for its power and relevance in the robotics industry. The book should provide a bridge to real-world robotics development, not just academic exercises.

## Success Criteria
- High reader engagement, measured by the number of readers who complete the capstone project.
- Positive reviews on learning platforms and community forums, specifically praising the practical examples.
- Adoption of the book's projects and codebases in university courses, workshops, or hobbyist portfolios.
- The final capstone project (the autonomous humanoid) is a functional and impressive demonstration of the book's teachings.

## Constraints
- **Target Audience:** Content must remain accessible to beginners to intermediate-level engineers and developers. Complex topics should be broken down into digestible parts.
- **Tech Stack:** The project is strictly bound to the specified technologies: Docusaurus, ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, and the NVIDIA Isaac platform. No new major dependencies should be introduced without a formal amendment.
- **Code Quality:** All code must be well-documented, commented, and follow consistent style guidelines.

## Stakeholders
- **Authors & Developers:** Responsible for creating accurate, high-quality content and code.
- **Technical Writers & Editors:** Responsible for ensuring clarity, consistency, and adherence to the brand voice.
- **Readers (Students, Engineers, Hobbyists):** The primary audience for whom the book is created. Their success is the project's success.

## Brand Voice
The tone should be **professional, inspiring, and actionable**. It should be encouraging to beginners while still being technically precise and valuable to those with some experience.

## Governance
This Constitution is the source of truth for the project's direction and standards. Any proposed deviation or amendment must be documented, reviewed by the core team, and formally approved. All project plans, specifications, and tasks must align with the principles outlined here.
